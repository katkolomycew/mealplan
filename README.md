Weekly Mealplans â€” October 2019 (personal)

A personal side project made with a love for food and a need for weekly organisation through busy weekdays. I strive to update it every week, and focused initially on playing around with some CSS features such as animation.

Were I to refactor this project, I would definitely refactor the code and likely build it through React.
